**Ticker:** N/A (Private)  
**Sector:** SaaS / Productivity / LegalTech  
**Stage:** Seed / Growth

---

## 1. Investment Highlights

*   **High Scalability, Low Cost:** The application runs client-side. We have **zero** storage costs and minimal server bandwidth costs regardless of user volume. The unit cost per user is effectively zero.
*   **Viral Utility:** The product solves a high-frequency friction point. Users naturally share the tool with colleagues after a successful "quick fix" experience.
*   **Data Privacy as a Moat:** In an era of GDPR and PDPA, our "No-Upload" architecture makes us the only viable web-based option for handling confidential contracts and financial statements.

## 2. Growth Strategy

### Phase 1: User Acquisition (Current)
*   **SEO Dominance:** Targeting keywords like "Cop Syarikat Online," "Digital Stamp Free," and "Edit PDF Malaysia."
*   **Community Growth:** Distribution via LinkedIn, SME Facebook groups, and Twitter/X tech circles.

### Phase 2: Retention & Ecosystem (Q3 2024)
*   **PWA (Progressive Web App):** Installable on Desktop and Mobile for offline use.
*   **Template Library:** Standard templates for Invoices, DOs, and LOIs.

### Phase 3: B2B Expansion (2025)
*   **Team Accounts:** allowing a Manager to upload a "Master Stamp" that employees can use but not download/steal.
*   **Integrations:** Plugins for Xero, QuickBooks, and Google Workspace.

## 3. Financial Projections (Projected)

| Metric | Year 1 (Growth) | Year 2 (Monetization) | Year 3 (Scale) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Active Users (MAU)** | 50,000 | 250,000 | 1,000,000+ |

## 4. The Ask

We are seeking **Strategic Partnerships** and **Seed Funding** to accelerate:

1.  **Marketing & Localization:** Translating the app into Bahasa Melayu, Chinese, and Tamil to capture the full Malaysian/ASEAN market.
2.  **Mobile App Development:** Native wrappers for iOS and Android to access file systems more deeply.
3.  **Legal Tech Compliance:** Certification for Digital Signatures (e.g., DocuSign integration or local CA authority).

## 5. Risk Factors

*   **Competition:** Adobe or Canva releasing a similar simplified free tool.
    *   *Mitigation:* Our focus is purely on "Stamping" speed and privacy, avoiding feature bloat.
*   **Browser Limitations:** Handling extremely large files (100MB+) in-browser.
    *   *Mitigation:* Implementing PDF streaming and chunking technologies.
